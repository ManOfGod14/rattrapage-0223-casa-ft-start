            <p>Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites? OK, if everyone's finished being stupid.</p>
            <p>Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. You are the last hope of the universe. Guess again. Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty? <strong> Humans dating robots is sick.</strong> <em> You people wonder why I'm still single?</em> It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans!</p>
            <h2>Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems.</h2>
            <p>Daylight and everything. Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers? My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually?</li>
                <li>Tell her she looks thin.</li>
                <li>Look, last night was a mistake.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <input type="text">

            <h3>All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school!</h3>
            <p>Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault! Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news!</li>
                <li>Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk!</li>
                <li>Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>And why did 'I' have to take a cab? No argument here. For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs! Really?! Noooooo! Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying!</p>
            <p>Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Leela's gonna kill me. File not found. So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct?</p>
            <p>Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! Ooh, name it after me! Large bet on myself in round one. Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful! Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried?</p>
            <p>But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. Oh God, what have I done? Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news!</p>
            <p>Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg! Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?</p>
            <p>Daddy Bender, we're hungry. I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. And until then, I can never die? You don't know how to do any of those.</p>
            <p>Then we'll go with that data file! Meh. Hey, whatcha watching? I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'!</p>
            <p>I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though! Guess again. I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared… Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.</p>
            <p>In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are. Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head.</p>
            <p>You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal! Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it?</p>
            <p>We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral! Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men. I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually?</p>
